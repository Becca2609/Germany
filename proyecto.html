      <td colspan="4"><p>The <strong>Berlin TV Tower (Fernsehturm)</strong> is one of the most recognizable landmarks in Germany and a powerful symbol of the country&rsquo;s recent history. It was built between 1965 and 1969 by the government of East Germany as a demonstration of socialist power and modern technology during the Cold War. Standing at 368 meters, it was designed to show the strength and progress of the German Democratic Republic. Located at Alexanderplatz, the tower quickly became a central point of East Berlin. After German reunification in 1990, the TV Tower lost its political meaning and became a symbol of a united Berlin. Today, it is one of the most visited attractions in the city, offering panoramic views and representing Berlin&rsquo;s transformation from division to openness and modernity.</p></td>

      <td colspan="4"><p>Another important place in Berlin is the <strong>East Side Gallery</strong>, which reflects the city&rsquo;s complex past. It is the longest remaining open-air section of the <strong>Berlin Wall</strong>, originally built in 1961 to separate East and West Berlin. After the fall of the Wall in 1989, artists from around the world painted murals on this section to celebrate freedom, peace, and political change. The artworks express emotions linked to division, oppression, and hope for unity. Alongside the East Side Gallery, Berlin is known for popular sites such as the <strong>Brandenburg Gate</strong>, once a symbol of separation and now of reunification, and <strong>Museum Island</strong>, which highlights Germany&rsquo;s cultural heritage. Together, these places provide historical, political, and cultural context to Berlin&rsquo;s identity.</p></td>
