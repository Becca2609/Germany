Among the most representative foods are sausages, schnitzel, sauerkraut, and pork knuckle, often served with potato salads, knödel, or spätzle. The culture of bread and beer is fundamental, and classic desserts like Black Forest cake and apple strudel also stand out, reflecting a simple, abundant cuisine closely tied to local customs.</h4></td>

      <td align="center">Traditional Bavarian cuisine, from southern  Germany, is famous for being hearty, rustic, and based on meat, roasts, and  dumplings. Iconic dishes include Schweinshaxe (roast pork knuckle), Weisswurst  (white sausage) with sweet mustard, Brezel (pretzel), and Knödel (potato or  bread dumplings), accompanied by local beer</td>
      <td align="center"><br>
      Schnitzel is a<strong> thin slice of meat</strong>. The meat is usually thinned by pounding with a meat tenderizer. Most commonly, the meat is breaded before frying. Breaded schnitzel is popular in many countries and is made using veal, pork, chicken, mutton, beef, or turkey</td>
      <td align="center">Currywurst is one of  Germany's most iconic and popular fast food dishes, especially in Berlin, where  it's considered a local specialty and a cultural symbol. It consists of a  German sausage (usually pork, like a Bratwurst or Bockwurst) that is grilled or  fried, sliced, and then coated in a tomato sauce or ketchup mixed with curry  powder</td>
      <td align="center"><p>Sauerkraut is finely shredded white cabbage  fermented with salt. This traditional German food becomes a crispy, tangy  pickle thanks to the action of natural lactic acid bacteria, resulting in a  probiotic that aids digestion and can be served with meats and sausages. Its  preparation involves salting and massaging the cabbage until it releases water,  then fermenting it in a jar for several weeks, creating a food rich in vitamins  and beneficial bacteria. </p></td>
